=head1 NAME

Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling::RegisterScalableTarget - Arguments for method RegisterScalableTarget on L<Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the parameters used for calling the method RegisterScalableTarget on the
L<Application Auto Scaling|Paws::ApplicationAutoScaling> service. Use the attributes of this class
as arguments to method RegisterScalableTarget.

You shouldn't make instances of this class. Each attribute should be used as a named argument in the call to RegisterScalableTarget.

As an example:

  $service_obj->RegisterScalableTarget(Att1 => $value1, Att2 => $value2, ...);

Values for attributes that are native types (Int, String, Float, etc) can passed as-is (scalar values). Values for complex Types (objects) can be passed as a HashRef. The keys and values of the hashref will be used to instance the underlying object.
For the AWS API documentation, see L<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/autoscaling/RegisterScalableTarget>

=head1 ATTRIBUTES


=head2 MaxCapacity => Int

The maximum value to scale to in response to a scale out event. This
parameter is required if you are registering a scalable target.



=head2 MinCapacity => Int

The minimum value to scale to in response to a scale in event. This
parameter is required if you are registering a scalable target.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ResourceId => Str

The identifier of the resource associated with the scalable target.
This string consists of the resource type and unique identifier.

=over

=item *

ECS service - The resource type is C<service> and the unique identifier
is the cluster name and service name. Example:
C<service/default/sample-webapp>.

=item *

Spot fleet request - The resource type is C<spot-fleet-request> and the
unique identifier is the Spot fleet request ID. Example:
C<spot-fleet-request/sfr-73fbd2ce-aa30-494c-8788-1cee4EXAMPLE>.

=item *

EMR cluster - The resource type is C<instancegroup> and the unique
identifier is the cluster ID and instance group ID. Example:
C<instancegroup/j-2EEZNYKUA1NTV/ig-1791Y4E1L8YI0>.

=item *

AppStream 2.0 fleet - The resource type is C<fleet> and the unique
identifier is the fleet name. Example: C<fleet/sample-fleet>.

=item *

DynamoDB table - The resource type is C<table> and the unique
identifier is the resource ID. Example: C<table/my-table>.

=item *

DynamoDB global secondary index - The resource type is C<index> and the
unique identifier is the resource ID. Example:
C<table/my-table/index/my-table-index>.

=item *

Aurora DB cluster - The resource type is C<cluster> and the unique
identifier is the cluster name. Example: C<cluster:my-db-cluster>.

=item *

Amazon SageMaker endpoint variants - The resource type is C<variant>
and the unique identifier is the resource ID. Example:
C<endpoint/my-end-point/variant/KMeansClustering>.

=back




=head2 RoleARN => Str

Application Auto Scaling creates a service-linked role that grants it
permissions to modify the scalable target on your behalf. For more
information, see Service-Linked Roles for Application Auto Scaling
(http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ApplicationAutoScaling/latest/APIReference/application-autoscaling-service-linked-roles.html).

For resources that are not supported using a service-linked role, this
parameter is required and must specify the ARN of an IAM role that
allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the scalable target on your
behalf.



=head2 B<REQUIRED> ScalableDimension => Str

The scalable dimension associated with the scalable target. This string
consists of the service namespace, resource type, and scaling property.

=over

=item *

C<ecs:service:DesiredCount> - The desired task count of an ECS service.

=item *

C<ec2:spot-fleet-request:TargetCapacity> - The target capacity of a
Spot fleet request.

=item *

C<elasticmapreduce:instancegroup:InstanceCount> - The instance count of
an EMR Instance Group.

=item *

C<appstream:fleet:DesiredCapacity> - The desired capacity of an
AppStream 2.0 fleet.

=item *

C<dynamodb:table:ReadCapacityUnits> - The provisioned read capacity for
a DynamoDB table.

=item *

C<dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits> - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB table.

=item *

C<dynamodb:index:ReadCapacityUnits> - The provisioned read capacity for
a DynamoDB global secondary index.

=item *

C<dynamodb:index:WriteCapacityUnits> - The provisioned write capacity
for a DynamoDB global secondary index.

=item *

C<rds:cluster:ReadReplicaCount> - The count of Aurora Replicas in an
Aurora DB cluster. Available for Aurora MySQL-compatible edition.

=item *

C<sagemaker:variant:DesiredInstanceCount> - The number of EC2 instances
for an Amazon SageMaker model endpoint variant.
